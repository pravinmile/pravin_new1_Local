        <h1>Anime</h1>
        <p class="para">Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term
            for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of
            the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan,
            distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi,
            romance, and supernatural forces. Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not
            all cartoons are anime. </p>
